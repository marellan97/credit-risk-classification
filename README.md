# Credit-Risk-Classification

# Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to create and evaluate the accuracy of a data model on a data set to predict the creditworthiness of borrowers from a peer-to-peer lending services company. 

# Results
* Balanced Accuracy Score: Is a metric we can use to assess the performance of a classification model. This means that when we take into account the sensitivity and specificity of the model, we had a balanced prediction accuracy of 95.2%.
  
* Precision Score: This is a useful measure of the success of prediction when the classes are very imbalanced. For this data set the precision score is 92%, therefore this means that 92% of predicted positives were correct.

* Recall Score: This is used to measure the model performance in terms of measuring the count of true positives in a correct manner out of all the actual positive values. For this dataset, the recall score is 95%, which means that the model was 95% precise in measuring the true postive values out of all the positive predictions that were made.

# Summary
After the results received, I would recomment using this model to predict the creditworthiness of borrowers. We had a 95% accuracy which is relatively very good in prediciting the outcome of repayment of the initial loan.
