# Credit-Risk-Classification

# Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to create and evaluate the accuracy of a data model on a data set to predict the creditworthiness of borrowers from a peer-to-peer lending services company. 

# Results

Machine Learning Model 1:
* This model has an accuracy score of 99%. 

* The precision score for healthy loans (0) is 100% and for high-risk loans (1) is at 85% which is not too bad. The precision score lets us know the percentage of predicted positives that were correct.

* The recall score was above 90% for both healthy loans (0) and high-risk loans (1). The label 0 recall score was quite high at 99% whereas label 1 had a recall score of 91%. The percentage lets us know the precision in measuring true positive values out of all positive predictions made. 

# Summary
After the results received, I would recommend using this model to predict the creditworthiness of borrowers. We had a 99% accuracy which is relatively very good in prediciting the outcome of repayment of the initial loan.
